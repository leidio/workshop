Workshop with 50+ participants. "The way we think about designing places and spaces is changing, going far beyond bricks and mortar to build experiences that anticipate future human behavior. In this Lab, attendees will explore tensions between the built environment and rapidly shifting consumer expectations: tensions between cars and mobility; hospitals and health; homes and living; and cities and communities. You'll learn the design and innovation process firsthand as you imagine and create new experiences that could revolutionize how we think about architecture and buildings, and impact the way we live for generations to come."
