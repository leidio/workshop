	Reconstructing the Mississippi delta as protective infrastructure

	<div class="projecttext">
	Changing Course proposes a regional reconfiguration of water control infrastructure along the Mississippi River below English Turn, just south of New Orleans, to rebuild the fraying delta by harnessing the river's greatest talent: land building. The immense watershed of the Mississippi delivers the eroded landscapes of the eastern Rockies, the Great Plains, and the Midwest to the vast swathes of marshland along the furry edge of the Gulf. Historically, the river built up land by depositing this sediment through seasonal flooding. Over time, as the river changed course, it built the delta up year by year, flood by flood.<br><br>
    Today fixed control insfrastructure contains the river within a single, permanent channel. While this protects communities from devastating floods, it also creates dependable nwaterways for the nation's largest continuous port system, stretching from La Balize to Baton Rouge. Through this rigid chute, the rich sediments that build up land through flooding are ultimately lost, spilled deep into the Gulf of Mexico. Maintaining the status quo has an unambiguous cost: erasure. Without a drastic rethinking of water infrastructure the sea will overrun and wash away south Louisiana. With a combination of porous infrastructure and traditional typology, Changing Course proposes an approach for rebuilding deltaic marshes and capturing sediment while protecting communities and industrial activities upon which the region depends.

    The Mississippi River reveals incredible global tensions. Unseen beneath the thick coastal marshes and the open ocean of the Gulf of Mexico is a dizzying network of infrastructure that moves gas and oil from the gulf to be refined and distributed on the shore. Insidiously, these instruments of the geo-economic topology are as invisible as fiberglass stuck in the skin.

                    New ground means there's a place for plants to take root and, consequently, for resilient ecosystems to recover. If healthy, these ecosystems strengthen the capacity for the marsh to act as a barrier against destructive storm surges by providing a range of plant species suitable to different conditions, such as water salinity and soil density. Without this diversity of healthy ecosystems, the marsh will be vulnerable to powerful climate events like hurricanes.

                    Without systemically rethinking river controls, communities have limited hope to remain viable, let alone grounded and dry.

                    That means making a compromise between where we build and where we don't, and designing new forms of infrastructure that allow the river to behave as it would without human intervention. Porous flood barriers would selectively allow seasonal flooding to occur while mostly containing the existing channel. Between enclosed protected areas, designated flood zones would expose the surrounding marsh to the full force of the river in order to distribute sediment without pipeline diversions.

                    The Mississippi River between La Balize and Baton Rouge is home to one of the largest combined port system in the world. Because existing industries will be no longer viable without drastic action to reconstruct lost marsh, commercial activity and the delta are mutually bound. Just as upstream activity affects the delta, what we do here reverberates upstream. Taken together, these strategies protect the navigation routes that the coastal economy depends on. That's true for the independent shrimp boat as much as it is for a world-cruising container ship.
