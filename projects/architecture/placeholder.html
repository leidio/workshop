	The future of shade is the sky

	<div class="projecttext">
	"Placeholder Public" is an illustrative idea that the future of shade is protecting against the sun and wind without removing—and indeed enhancing—a view to the sky above. This is very rare in civic life, and architecture does not typically consider our relationship to the world above. We like the idea that Sunbrella might be used, ironically, to articulate a skyward experience. 
	B-Side Office proposes a system of curvaceous sail-shades that ebb in orientation like water or wind itself, and affix to a rigid grid structure that can be one module or one hundred in size. Through variation in composition, these sails fluidly create rooms that can be used for anything. Perhaps a restaurant creates a dining cabana, or a homeowner creates a sleeping tent. Perhaps the city creates a landscape full of sails as part of a new park, leaving a continuity of rooms in which to explore, play, rest, eat, love, and (of course) look up to the sky. Or perhaps they just show up one day in an abandoned, overgrown lot. Who would have thought that a shade structure could create an entirely new form of public space that works pretty much anywhere?
