            As a designer with a background in architecture, I am deeply fascinated by the coastline. These zones where the sea and its mythic vastness meets the world as we've built it are messy and complicated physically and psychologically. As we change the ocean, the ocean will change us. Coastlines are the front line of that tension, and along this margin we will have to envision and create new ways of living with water. From this generative chaos will come new forms of buildings, community, and interaction with the forces of nature that will permanently transfigure the human environment. <br><br>

The coastline will always be a thriving margin in the human environment, and in upcoming decades and beyond, we will have to adapt in fundamentally new ways to living with water. As a naturalist, this is a future of despair.

                <br><br>
                From the beginning, I felt transparent to Lake Michigan as though it was a part of me. The Great Lakes defined my idea of wilderness and the blurred line between nature and not-nature. On the one hand, the shore of Lake Michigan, blazing in the afternoon sun, was as unblemished as I could imagine the world ever being. The strip malls and hot parking lots of the city were in authentic obstructions. On the other hand, I feared my very presence there disrupted and even threatened its purity. <br><br>This has become a deep-seeded part of how I think about architecture, the built environment, and our place as humans in a world of which we are ultimately as legitimate a part as anything else. <b>But we have to choose to be stewards.</b> As a designer, this value informs all of my work regardless of content. Even as an interaction designer I'm always asking, what is this enabling? What is this preventing?

                <div class="projecttext blue1">
                Here, the tenuous balance the city holds with the sea is inescapable. 
                    <br>
                    Because the city is shaped like a bowl, when it rains water pools in the lowest and most challenged parts of the city. To prevent flooding, the city pumps water out of the bowl back out to the Gulf via Lake Pontchartrain. But because that water doesn't soak back into the sediment on which New Orleans rests, the city is subsiding at a rate that is indexed in the warped sidewalks and raised roadbeds. Meanwhile, the control structures that prevent seasonal flooding also prevent sediment from building up during floods and creating new land—land that becomes part of the vast Mississippi delta and serves as a buffer from the sea. 
                    <br><br>But the deltaic marshes that do exist—built up over thousands of years of flooding—have been sliced through with pipeline and wellhead channels, and the fabric of the marsh is eroding. Salt water seeps in further and destroys the plants that hold the land in place. And during hurricanes, storm surges are more destructive because there is less natural defense for the marsh. With sea level rise on top of that, the Louisiana delta is in a downward spiral, and New Orleans is at constant risk.<br><br>Large-scale infrastructure to prevent flooding is the only defense; even so, before too long, New Orleans will be its own Venice:<br><b>a mythical city on an island,</b> surrounded by the sea.

            As a boy from the lakes, the wild coastline of Lake Superior is a romantic and privileged retreat, tempting me to escape the challenges of the modern world. I have a heroic architect's daydream about building with nature rather than against it, to embrace limitations rather than resist them. But this goes way beyond building technology or construction; it's about how space becomes culture, enabling life practices and relationships between each other and resources that cultivate thriving.
                <br>
                <br>
                Growing up, I formed a profound appreciation for the natural world, and even now feel most at home anonymous in the land. This reflects my bias to consider the Great Lakes and, by extension, the entire natural world as a part of culture based on <b>the idea of separation.</b> We're lake people because we know to go to the water when we need to get away, to feel at home.

            To come into New Orleans you have to cross water. A lot of it: miles and miles.<br>
            Except for a narrow strip along the natural levee of the Mississippi, it is an island for all practical purposes. And its islandness isn't just physical: it's social and cultural too. In New Orleans, the energy of the city hits the nebulous boundary of the island and bounces right back in. It feeds the city again, thickening the <b>place like a good roux.</b>
                <br><br>
                Even wtih the nation's largest combined port system at the terminus of a transcontinental railroad, the city is an economic island as well. Pipelines from the gulf and trains from the Great Plains land here as a transfer point on greater journeys across vaster geography. New Orleans has to import everything it needs, and its livelihood is inextricably tied to the state of the coast.

              It's easiest to think of the sea as a formal other, the focus of scientists and fishermen who go <b>"out there"</b> with special equipment. Most people access it in structured ways: the state beach, private beachfront property, a cruise, or childhood books about sea creatures and old myths. We still think of it as something that's pure, a part of the world where humans are overruled and have no say.
            <br><br>
        But our relationship to the sea is anything but monolithic. It is fragmented and immensely complex. Even a thousand feet above sea level, deep in the interior, the sea holds sway over us even as we contribute to its transformation through the logics of capital and consumption.
