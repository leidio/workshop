            As a designer with a background in architecture, I am deeply fascinated by the coastline. These zones where the sea and its mythic vastness meets the world as we've built it are messy and complicated physically and psychologically. As we change the ocean, the ocean will change us. Coastlines are the front line of that tension, and along this margin we will have to envision and create new ways of living with water. From this generative chaos will come new forms of buildings, community, and interaction with the forces of nature that will permanently transfigure the human environment.<br><br>

                    From the beginning, I felt transparent to Lake Michigan as though it was a part of me. The Great Lakes defined my idea of wilderness and the blurred line between nature and not-nature. On the one hand, the shore of Lake Michigan, blazing in the afternoon sun, was as unblemished as I could imagine the world ever being. The strip malls and hot parking lots of the city were in authentic obstructions. On the other hand, I feared my very presence there disrupted and even threatened its purity. <br><br>This has become a deep-seeded part of how I think about architecture, the built environment, and our place as humans in a world of which we are ultimately as legitimate a part as anything else. <b>But we have to choose to be stewards.</b> As a designer, this value informs all of my work regardless of content. Even as an interaction designer I'm always asking, what is this enabling? What is this preventing?

                    Here, the tenuous balance the city holds with the sea is inescapable. 
                        <br>
                        Because the city is shaped like a bowl, when it rains water pools in the lowest and most challenged parts of the city. To prevent flooding, the city pumps water out of the bowl back out to the Gulf via Lake Pontchartrain. But because that water doesn't soak back into the sediment on which New Orleans rests, the city is subsiding at a rate that is indexed in the warped sidewalks and raised roadbeds. Meanwhile, the control structures that prevent seasonal flooding also prevent sediment from building up during floods and creating new land—land that becomes part of the vast Mississippi delta and serves as a buffer from the sea. 
                        <br><br>But the deltaic marshes that do exist—built up over thousands of years of flooding—have been sliced through with pipeline and wellhead channels, and the fabric of the marsh is eroding. Salt water seeps in further and destroys the plants that hold the land in place. And during hurricanes, storm surges are more destructive because there is less natural defense for the marsh. With sea level rise on top of that, the Louisiana delta is in a downward spiral, and New Orleans is at constant risk.<br><br>Large-scale infrastructure to prevent flooding is the only defense; even so, before too long, New Orleans will be its own Venice:<br><b>a mythical city on an island,</b> surrounded by the sea.

                As a boy from the lakes, the wild coastline of Lake Superior is a romantic and privileged retreat, tempting me to escape the challenges of the modern world. I have a heroic architect's daydream about building with nature rather than against it, to embrace limitations rather than resist them. But this goes way beyond building technology or construction; it's about how space becomes culture, enabling life practices and relationships between each other and resources that cultivate thriving.

                    Growing up, I formed a profound appreciation for the natural world, and even now feel most at home anonymous in the land. This reflects my bias to consider the Great Lakes and, by extension, the entire natural world as a part of culture based on <b>the idea of separation.</b> We're lake people because we know to go to the water when we need to get away, to feel at home.

                    Changing Course proposes a <b>regional reconfiguration of water control infrastructure</b> along the Mississippi River below English Turn, just south of New Orleans, to rebuild the fraying delta by harnessing the river's greatest talent: land building.<br><br>
                    The immense watershed of the Mississippi delivers the eroded landscapes of the eastern Rockies, the Great Plains, and the Midwest to the vast swathes of marshland along the furry edge of the Gulf. Historically, the river built up land by depositing this sediment through seasonal flooding. Over time, as the river changed course, it built the delta up year by year, flood by flood.<br><br>
                    Today fixed control insfrastructure contains the river within a single, permanent channel. While this protects communities from devastating floods, it also creates dependable nwaterways for the nation's largest continuous port system, stretching from La Balize to Baton Rouge. Through this rigid chute, the rich sediments that build up land through flooding are ultimately lost, spilled deep into the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>
                    Maintaining the status quo has an unambiguous cost: <b>erasure.</b> Without a drastic rethinking of water infrastructure the sea will overrun and wash away south Louisiana. With a combination of porous infrastructure and traditional typology, Changing Course proposes an approach for rebuilding deltaic marshes and capturing sediment while protecting communities and industrial activities upon which the region depends.

If healthy, these ecosystems strengthen the capacity for the marsh to act as a barrier against destructive storm surges by providing a range of plant species suitable to different conditions, such as water salinity and soil density. Without this diversity of healthy ecosystems, the marsh will be vulnerable to powerful climate events like hurricanes.

                    That means making a compromise between where we build and where we don't, and designing new forms of infrastructure that allow the river to behave as it would without human intervention. Porous flood barriers would selectively allow seasonal flooding to occur while mostly containing the existing channel. Between enclosed protected areas, designated flood zones would expose the surrounding marsh to the full force of the river in order to distribute sediment without pipeline diversions.

                    The Mississippi River between La Balize and Baton Rouge is home to one of the largest combined port system in the world. Because existing industries will be no longer viable without drastic action to reconstruct lost marsh, commercial activity and the delta are mutually bound. Just as upstream activity affects the delta, what we do here reverberates upstream. Taken together, these strategies protect the navigation routes that the coastal economy depends on. That's true for the independent shrimp boat as much as it is for a world-cruising container ship.

Along with a group of colleagues, friends, and partners, Ripple Effect piloted a place-based science curriculum at Claire's school that used design thinking to creatively meet science standards while also addressing a need vital to Louisiana's future: to teach the next generation about the region's complicated relationship with water.

                Ripple Effect brought teachers, designers, and water experts together to create a water curriculum for K-5 classrooms. 
                <br><br>
                With the help of designers, teachers developed in-classroom design-based projects to introduce lessons, and in-field experiences outside the classroom to connect learning to place. While many students had heard of Bayou St. John, a waterway in the city, few had ever been out on the water, or even visited. Because the Ripple Effect curriculum used the bayou to teach students about the water cycle, the shape of landscape, city systems, and waterways, being out on the water brought the lesson full circle.

By this point, we started to imagine a whole range of design thinking and ethnographic methods that Ripple Effect to incorporate into K-12 pedagogy in the future, and water was just the starting point...
