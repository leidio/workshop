        As a designer with a background in architecture, my fascination lies at the coastline, the margin where the sea and its mythic vastness meets the world as we've built it. The seas are coming for us, and we will have to invent new ways to live. Coastlines are the site of that tension, but also that generative chaos. etc. etc. <br>

        As a boy from the lakes, the wild coastline of Lake Superior is a romantic and privileged retreat, tempting me to escape the challenges of the modern world. I have a heroic architect's daydream about building with nature rather than against it, to embrace limitations rather than resist them. But this goes way beyond building technology or construction; it's about how space becomes culture, enabling life practices and relationships between each other and resources that cultivate thriving.
            <br>
            <br>
            Growing up, I formed a profound appreciation for the natural world, and even now feel most at home anonymous in the land. This reflects my bias to consider the Great Lakes and, by extension, all of the natural world as a part of <b>culture based on separation.</b> We're lake people because we know to go to the water when we need separation.

        To come into New Orleans you have to cross water. A lot of it: miles and miles.<br>
        Except for a narrow strip along the natural levee of the Mississippi, it is an island for all practical purposes. And its islandness isn't just physical: it's social and cultural too. In New Orleans, the energy of the city hits the nebulous boundary of the island and bounces right back in. It feeds the city again, thickening the place just like a good roux.
            <br><br>
            Even wtih the nation's largest combined port system at the terminus of a transcontinental railroad, the city is an economic island as well. Pipelines from the gulf and trains from the Great Plains land here as a transfer point on greater journeys across vaster geography. New Orleans has to import everything it needs, and its livelihood is inextricably tied to the state of the coast.

          It's easiest to think of the sea as a formal other, the focus of scientists and fishermen who go "out there" with special equipment. Most people access it in structured ways: the state beach, private beachfront property, a cruise, or childhood books about sea creatures and old myths. We still think of it as something that's pure, a part of the world where humans are overruled and have no say.
        <br><br>
    But our relationship to the sea is anything but monolithic. It is fragmented and immensely complex. Even a thousand feet above sea level, deep in the interior, the sea holds sway over us even as we contribute to its transformation through the logics of capital and consumption.

            It will do so with unrelenting physical force. <br><br>
                And it will do so quietly and surreptitiously in ways we are still trying to understand. The coastline will always be a thriving margin in the human environment, and in upcoming decades and beyond, we will have to adapt in fundamentally new ways to living with water. As a naturalist, this is a future of despair. 
                <br>
                <br>
                But as an architect, I'm excited. This is going to open up new kinds of architecture, building technology, material possibilities, and ways of living and sustaining communities. And it will require a way of learning and thinking that has either been lost since we first built walls to hold back the sea, or has never before existed in the human psyche. How do we learn? How do we think? How do we make for a future where home is on the water?
